##First of all, create a folder in your computer, which helps to organize your main and your own branch. 

##Second, clone the main branch and other branch via git bash. For example, git clone <URL from GitHub>

##Third, use VS code to open the folder that you cloned from GitHub, which could be either main or personal branch. This particular folder represents your branch that your just cloned from GitHub. 

##Next, you want to update your local repository. You have to make sure your file is in the folder(repository) that link with your cloud repository. Once, a file is added. Go back to VS code and add file to staged change and add commit. And you can synchronize your local folder(repository) with your cloud repository.

Caution: Before you commit and push your files to the cloud repository, make sure you check the branch you want to push. Otherwise, there is chaos. How to check the branch? Check left bottom on VS code. 

##If you want to pull or update your local repository, open the linked folder in VS code and click the cycle on the left bottom of VS code. That should do the job.
